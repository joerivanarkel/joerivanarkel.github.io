    <h1 id="aboutme">Joeri van Arkel</h1>
    <p>
        .NET developer with a focus on building reliable, maintainable software. I enjoy working
        end-to-end: from designing clean APIs to shipping apps and automations. Most of my work
        centers around C#, Blazor, and tooling that improves developer workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like keeping things pragmatic and well-structured, and I'm always refining my setup
        from CI/CD pipelines to shared packages. You can find a few of those in my public repos.
